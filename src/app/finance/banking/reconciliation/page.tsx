          Bank reconciliation is the process of comparing your internal financial records with your bank statements to
          ensure they match. Regular reconciliation helps catch errors, identify missing transactions, and maintain
          accurate financial records.

              Transactions you've recorded but that haven't cleared the bank yet. These are normal and will be included
              in your next reconciliation.

            <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-2">
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Mark these as uncleared and include them in next month's reconciliation.

            <p className="text-sm mt-2">
              Banks often charge fees or pay interest that you may not have recorded in your system.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-2">
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Add these transactions during reconciliation, categorizing them appropriately.

              Switching digits when entering amounts (e.g., entering 1,540 instead of 1,450).
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-2">
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Look for differences that are divisible by 9, which often indicates
              transposition. Correct the amount in your records.

          Best Practices for Bank Reconciliation
        </h2>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Reconcile Monthly:</span> Perform reconciliation at least once a month, after
            receiving your bank statement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Don't Skip Months:</span> If you miss a month, go back and reconcile it before
            moving forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Keep Documentation:</span> Save bank statements and reconciliation reports for
            your records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Investigate Discrepancies:</span> Don't force a reconciliation if there's a
            differenceâ€”find and fix the error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Separate Duties:</span> If possible, have someone other than the person who
            records transactions perform the reconciliation.

          <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic">
            "Aisha runs a tailoring business and reconciles her bank accounts on the 5th of each month when her
            statements arrive. During her May reconciliation, she noticed a AED 250 difference between her records and
            the bank statement. After reviewing the transactions, she discovered she had recorded a fabric purchase as
            AED 1,250 when it was actually AED 1,500. She corrected the error in her system and completed the
            reconciliation with a zero difference. This process not only fixed her accounting records but also updated
            her fabric cost tracking, ensuring her pricing calculations remained accurate. Without regular
            reconciliation, this error might have gone unnoticed and affected her profitability analysis."
